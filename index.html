            <p>My name is Namata Sharifa and am from SouthAfrica aged 27 years a mother of one girl
                and
                expecting a boy soon .My dream is to become a Software Engineer.I love working
                remotely
                so that i can have ample time with my family .Ave always tried to inquire about
                software field since my highschool but people kept discouraging me how its not for
                girls and this scared me....But when i did more and more research as someone who
                doesnt give up so easily, i found out that this was a lie and what still kept me
                away this long is the tution that universities charged to offer you a software
                engineering course not until i found BYU-Idaho. And i said why not give it a shot.
                Here we are. The road isnt that smooth as anyone might think but its worth a short
                so help me God. </p>.
