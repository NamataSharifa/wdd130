            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>In 1999, Mustafa Mugenyi launched White-Water Rafting Company with one raft, a few
                paddles, and a passion for the river. Starting with White Nile river, we guided
                small groups through thrilling rapids, blending adventure with safety. From
                those early days , we've grown into a trusted outfitter with expert guides, custom
                gear, and routes for every skill level. Through floods, expansions, and countless
                unforgettable trips, our mission remains the same; helping you experience the
                river's story, one rapid at a time.
